              This talk was recorded for the MIDAS Network Annual Meeting
              as a video presentation on 30 April 2021, and was presented on 10 May.
              Text here will supplement slide material.

              Now, one of the major points of this talk is to advertise an online tool that
              we've created to explore the relationship between contact networks structure and
              disease spread, and I promise I'll get to a walk through of the app, but first,
              I'm going to explain a bit of the how and why behind the app we developed.

            <p>
              A little over a year ago, there were widespred lockdowns across the US.
              In this map from the New York Times, we see that many states invoked state-wide
              lockdowns on travel and business. This was a blunt tool to try to avoid a rising
              catastrophe, but the reasoning behind it was rooted in an understanding of how
              diseases are transmitted from person to person; if we could prevent disease-spreading
              contacts, then we could pre-empt the pandemic. It doesn't take a disease ecologist to realize that
              there is room for improvement in this approach. For instance, what if we could limit our
              intervention to preventing only those contacts that are most critical to disease spread,
              leaving other interactions, perhaps even the majority of interactions, intact at the same time.

              To dive into this problem, we considered two integral parts of disease spread: the
              contact network upon which the disease spreads, and the underlying dynamics of
              disease progression in any given person, independently. We then chose to focus on the
              former as our target for intervention, beginning with generating realistic, synthetic contact networks.

            <p>
              To do this we had to answer a couple of basic questions, such as "What is a contact?"
              The answer to this question is obviously context specific, but with COVID-19, with its
              aerosolized transmission, we think about the risk of transmission increasing with the 
              duration of people sharing the same air space.
            </p> 
            <span id="ns">next slide</span>
            <p>
              But of course the ways in which we are close to other people is also context dependent,
              leading to the key insight for this project: the structure of our interactions with other
              people is dependent on the different ways in which we interact with different facets of our
              social network.
            </p>
            <p>
              To put it more concretely, we interact with co-workers differently than we interact with
              people at home, or at a religious institution. The differences in these interactions,
              including the strength of interaction and the interacting group size, can have consequences
              for the spread of disease.

              So, we begin to assemble our networks: starting with a collection of individuals, whose ages are
              distributed according to some locality's census data and grouping them into households, based on
              the empirical distribution of household sizes. We then successively layer additional interaction
              types, including schools,

            <span id="ns">next slide</span>

              and possibly others (each likewise based on empirical data whenever possible).

            <span id="ns">next slide</span>
            <p>
              Importantly, because each node has an age associated with it, we can also classify some
              individuals as being more vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID, using age-normalized
              hospitalization rates. Here, we dichotomize individuals into "Vulnerable" or "Not" for simplicity.

              I want to take a minute to run through the underlying disease model, but since I'm
              sure most of you have seen these types of models explained, and perhaps explained them
              yourselves, multiple times, I will keep it very brief.

              At each timestep in a simulation, every individual in the network has one of six states.
              They start out as <span class="blue">S</span>usceptible to disease and can become infected when they share an edge,
              representing a social contact, with an infectious individual.
            </p>
            <span id="ns">next slide</span>
            <p>
              Upon infection, they enter a latency period and are classified as <span class="green">E</span>xposed, but not yet infectious.
              Over time, they transition to being <span class="yellow">I</span>/<span class="orange">I</span>nfectious, and some fraction will develop symptoms.

            <span id="ns">next slide</span>

              The final piece of the puzzle is that those individuals that we classified as vulnerable have 
              both longer disease courses (slower recovery),

            So, for a single simulated epidemic, we see nodes cycling through the various
            disease states, and, on the right, the proportion of the population in each
            class through time. Note that some individuals are able to escape infection,
            even at the end of the simulation, if they are sparsely connected to the rest of the
            network, or just very lucky.
