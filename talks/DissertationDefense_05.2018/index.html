            <p>The area of network science that most fascinates me is network
            structure. As networks became more commonplace, a natural question
            arose of how to compare networks to one another. Initially,
            scientists would just look at differences in the core components of
            networks, starting with size, that is, the number of things in the
            network. Represented here by these circles,</p>
            <span id="ns">next slide</span>
            <p>The second core component of a network is connections between the
            nodes, usually termed "links" or "edges." Here, these are depicted
            with lines connecting the dots. notice that nodes can interact with
            themselves to produce what are called "self-loops" and that these
            edges (while undirected and all of the same strength here) can also
            convey this more sophisticated information in the general case. A
            summary statistic about edges that is often looked at in network
            science is the connectance which is just the proportion of all edges
            possible that are actually present in a given network. Here, that
            value is about $0.5$</p>
            <span id="ns">next slide</span>
            <p>One step up in complexity of network structure is to look at
            properties of individual nodes in the network, for instance their
            degree which is just another way to say the number of links
            connected to that node. </p>

            <p>Especially in ecology, two "global" network structures have
            dominated investigations into network structure. These structures
            involve every node in the network, and are usually summarised with a
            single value.</p>
            <p>The first of these popular ecological structures is "Nestedness"
            which is a attempt to quantify the degree to which the interactions
            of specialists are a subset of generalists' interactions. This
            results in a triangular network representation as seen in this modified
            figure of phages infecting bacteria from <a
            href="http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/">Joshua Weitz's group at
            Georgia Tech</a>.</p>
            <span id="ns">next slide</span>
            <p>The second structure is called "Modularity," also called
            compartmentalization. This structure asks to what degree can species
            be divided into subgroups which interact strongly within the group,
            but weakly (or not at all in this toy example) with members of other
            such groups.</p>
            <p>For each of these structures, multiple methods of quantification
            have been proposed, but they are, in-general, computationally intensive
            to do well</p>
            <span id="ns">next slide</span>
            <p>As a side note, these networks have an additional structure that comes
            up throughout this talk: they are bipartite. This means that, unline the
            toy network in the previous slide, in which any node can be connected to
            any other node, in these networks, the nodes can be divided into two classes
            for which all interactions are between nodes of disparate class. In this
            example, all links connect a virus to a bacterium; there are no links
            betweeen two viruses or between two bacteria.</p>

            <p>While the examination of the properties of small webs in isolation dates
            back decades, more recently these subgraphs or "motifs" have been interpreted
            as "building blocks" of larger networks.</p>
            <p>For example, any network can be broken down into each possible combination
            of three connected nodes in the network, of which there are then only 13 possible
            configurations for the links to take. We can then tally up how many of each
            of these configurations there are in a given network or set of networks.</p>

            <p>For example, in this study by <a href="https://jjborrelli.github.io/">Jonathan Borrelli</a>,
            now at SUNY Plattsburgh, we see that across 50 food-webs we find that the same
          subgraphs are more or less common in each of the analyzed webs.</p>

              <p>The project arose from a fairly simple question, with some surprisingly
              complicated secondary considerations. First, we should probably clear up some
              of the terminology.</p>
              <span id="ns">next slide</span>
              <p>By types, we are mainly thinking about the type of ecological interaction
              being represented, <i>e.g.</i> pollination, parasitism, seed-dispersal, <i>etc.</i>.</p>
              <span id="ns">next slide</span>
              <p>and by structure, we mean all of those arrangements of links mentioned in the
                introduction and any others that we can think of. Here we are only restricted by
              the computational effort required to measure something on many networks, some of which
            can be quite large.</p>
            <p>Also, just to be clear, in this project we were only looking at bipartite networks,
            as this tends to be the structure of type-specific ecological interaction networks.</p>

              <p>In this and the following slides, I will be demonstrating a
              potential solution which has some success, but several sortcomings
              as well. For these figures, I am using a PCA that has been fit <!--TODO emphasize that PCA does not see categorizations -->
              using a subset of non-ecological networks including webs of actors
              performing in the same movies, authors publishing in the same
              journals, crimes committed in different neighborhoods in different
              cities, legislature voting records, and mirobiome OTU
              presence/absence data across sites on human hosts.</p>
              <p>These non-ecological data have an advantage of being fairly
              large and consistent in their collection methods, as well as being
              very highly replicated compared to ecological data.</p>
              <p>One of the best ways to demonstrate that you are not
              overfitting your model. That is, that you are not fitting your
              model to a particular set of data rather than to the general class
              of data you are interested in. Is to divide your data into fitting
              and testing sets. Here, we use $100$ networks from each type to
              fit the PCA and then ...</p>

            <p>To test this, we randomize the structure of each of our networks according to a
            randomization protocol and see whether or not this breaks the clustering. We do this randomization in two ways, first a randomization that
          preserved degree distribution: each node in the randomized web has the same number of connections as in the original network,

              <p>But why didn't our method work? Maybe we didn't measure the
              right metrics or maybe PCA is too simplistic of a clustering
              technique. Alternatively, maybe the ecological networks we have
              are of too-low quality to be able to get at the fine-scale
              structural differences between networks of mutualistic and
              antagonistic interactions.</p>
              <p>An alternative interpretation is that it actually did work.
              Maybe it is just that the variation within ecological networks
              is greater than the variation between networks of differing
              interaction types.</p>
              <p>To address this latter point, I will be continuing to add data
              to the repository, but I am also interested in trying out some of
              the machine learning techniques which are a bit more sophisticated

              explains some of the many complications that arise when trying
              to systematically differentiate parasites from other
              life-cycles we observe in nature He discounts the first option since
              many predators consume prey that are larger than themselves (e.g.
              wolves eating moose) and the second with a similar argument:
              lions spend weeks consuming a single antelope.</p>
              <p>Though he settles on the number of hosts/prey attacked in a
              particular life-history stage as a good indicator, with parasites
              attacking fewer (usually only one), this is difficult to measure

              that the owl is a predator and the tick a parasite, but
              theoretical ecologists tend to see this picture a little
              differently...</p>
              <span id="ns">next slide</span>
              <p>When the additional information of ecological classifications
              is unavailable, e.g. with a  previously unobserved species,
              parasites and consumers look much more similar.</p>
              <p>This project started as a question of whether or not we can
              identify species roles based just on this information, that is,
              the network structure.</p>
              <p>Put another way, can we do what an ecologist does when
              observing species extensively in the field by just looking at the
              binary network of interactions?</p>
              <p>By approaching this problem in a more statistical way, we can
              more explicitly identify the important, distinguishing
              characteristics, and provide justification (or not) for the
              characteristics that are thought to be important.</p>

            <p>Every network can also be viewed as a matrix. When we do this, the

            <p>One feature of food-webs viewed in this way is that they tend to
            have a "cascade structure" -- that is, the interactions tend to show
            a pattern in which the majority of the links fall above the diagonal

            <p>One unique feature of symbionts, such as parasites, is that they can
              be consumed by "accident" when their host is consumed. Note that these
              links tend to fall in the lower triangle. This difference is one of
              the structural cues we can use to distinguish species from one another.</p>

          <p>Ecological classifications, such as herbivore or parasite, are
          assigned by ecologists following a detailed investigation of the
          species life history and, in particular, its interactions with other
          species. Another approach to group species is to look at the overall
          network structure and to group species that eat or are eaten by the
          same or similar prey or predators.</p>
          <p>In 2009, Allesina &amp; Pascual introduced the group model to ecology
          to make this concept statistically rigorous. The model had been used
          previously in the social sciences under a different name -- the
          stochastic blockmodel. This model works by re-arranging the rows/columns
          of the matrix in order to form blocks of species with similar interactions.</p>

          <p>So, if we look back to our food-web from before, we can re-arrange

          <span id="ns">next slide</span>
          <p>... to find a grouping such as this,
            where there are many blocks with no links, and a few blocks with a
            high density of links.</p>
            <p>One drawback of this model (in general, though not evident in this
              case) is that the degree -- i.e. the number of consumptive
              interactions a species has -- can influence the grouping in
              undesirable ways, such as artificially grouping specialists together
              just because they all have few prey.</p>
              <p>To account for this, in this project, we also used a modified version
                of the group model that accounts for the differences in degree across

          <p>Once we have these statistical groupings, we want to know how well

          <p>we want to calculate how "imbalanced"
          the groupings are with respect to the provided groupings. Are all of
          the parasites in a group by themselves? or are they evenly spaced

          explicitly</p>
          <span id="ns">next slide</span>
          <p>how likely it is for such a level of imbalance to arise by chance.</p>
          <p>We can apply this proceedure for each ecological classification
          (as well as look at all of them at once).</p>
          <span id="ns">next slide</span>
          <p>In this case, we see that the top grouping does well for
          producers and parasites, while the bottom grouping is more
          evenly spread (i.e. nonsignificant). Note that even though one of the degree-corrected
          groups is made up of entirely herbivores, the p-value is still
          quite high because it is not very unlikely for such a configuration
          to occur given this number of herbivores and groups.</p>

          <p>This table summarizes how imbalanced each category was for a given
          model and number of groups (g), again looking at the Punta Banda network.
          The numbers are not as important as the p-values, so I will highlight here just
          according to significance, that is, imbalance values that are
          substantially lower than would be expected by chance.</p>

          <p>Red corresponds to an alpha value of one tenth of one percent.</p>
          <p>Note that, despite the difference in degree we saw in the previous figure,
            the degree-corrected group model produced significantly more imbalanced
            groups, regardless of concomitant predation
            (paired t-test, estimated difference: .12, p < .001 and .067, p < .001,
            when including/excluding concomitant predation, respectively).
            This suggests that degree is not an essential distinguishing factor for parasites.</p>
            <p>Including concomitant links also produced more imbalanced groups,
              under both the degree-corrected (paired t-test, estimated
              difference: .034, p = .0049) and uncorrected (estimated difference:
              203 .085, p < .001) models.</p>

          <p>A more concise way to view these networks is to collapse the groups
          into a single node, colored according to the ecological classifications
          of the nodes within it.</p>
          <p>In this case, for example, the species have been divided into two
          groups, with one of the groups consisting entirely of consumers. This
          suggests that consumers are behaving in a unique way, i.e. the network
          structure of a given consumer is more similar to other consumers than
          to non-consumers.</p>
          <span id="ns">next slide</span>
          <p>Likewise, when we constrain the number of groups to 3, we still see
            consumers coming out, but now we see a group that is mostly parasites
            as well.</p>
          <span id="ns">next slide</span>
          <p>When we have five groups, something intesting happens: the consumer
            block is split in two. This is suggestive of additional structure
            within these gross ecological categories. Put another way, there are
            sub-structures within the consumer class where the differences between
            the sub-categorizations are more explanatory than the difference between
            consumers at large and other ecological categories.</p>
          <span id="ns">next slide</span>
          <p>Finally, the highest number of groups we looked at: 10 groups we get
          some uniform groups, and some groups that are still conglomerates.
          This shows that while our statistical approach does resemble the
          ecological categorizations, there are larger statistical differences
          between members of the same categorizations than between different
          ones. Some of the cateogories are better parsed than others, which
          suggests that these categories have a stronger foundation in network
          structure.</p>

          <p>So what can we take away from this?</p>
          <p>Well, it is comforting to know that the classifications that ecologists
          use in the field have statistical meaning with regards to network
          structure, and that these differences extend beyond simple degree
          distribution (the degree-corrected model produced more imbalanced
          partitions, suggesting that discounting the effect of degree in fact
          improved the ability to distinguish ecological categorizations).</p>
          <p>Interestingly, the intra-category differences were stronger than the
          inter-category differences in some cases, suggesting there might be
          more informative classifications than the one we used here.</p>
          <p>Concomitant links are useful, but not the end-all in distinguishing
          parasites and consumers.</p>
          <p>Finally, we can use these groupings (especially the homogenous ones)
          to identify the properties that differ between categorizations. These
          differences can then be used to produce more rigorous
          definitions and provide insight into the important distinctions between species
          roles in nature.</p>

              <p>While it is true that at first-glance these three projects appear to have little in
              common, each of them looks at the relationship between network structure and ecological
              processes underlying the construction and maintenance of those networks.</p>
              <p>In particular, I want to highlight that there are patterns in ecological network
              structure that exist to be found and explored further. While the first project's main
              message was that such structures can be difficult to find, even in this "negative" result
              is information on the variance inherent to ecological systems. in the second project,
              we find that there are structural signatures for the commonly described trophic roles,
              even parasites which are notoriously difficult to define precisely. Finally, in this last
              section, I've shown the endpoints in a spectrum of stability for competetive networks,
              revealing that both ends have clear, interpretable structures.</p>

              <p>I want to end with a note on two areas of growing research that
              I think will be fruitful avenues for Ecology in the near future:
              multi-layer networks and dynamic networks. Both of these are
              extensions to more tradtional network representations,
              incorporating greater realism at the expense of greater
              complexity. It will be important in the coming years to both
              develop methods for understanding these new data representations,
              but also to critically evaluate whether this complexity is worth
              it in terms of greater understanding or predictability.</p>
