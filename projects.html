      More than 40 years ago, <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ScXat-4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Robert May</a> introduced random matrices to ecology in a famous demonstration of the relationship between complexity and stability which was counter to the prevailing view of the time (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v238/n5364/abs/238413a0.html">May 1972</a>).
      Following a long hiatus, random matrices have recently re-emerged as the impetus behind several important advances in our understanding of complex ecological systems, spearheaded by <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eQunDs0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Si Tang</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=14DTOacAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Stefano Allesina</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7388/abs/nature10832.html">Allesina &amp; Tang 2012</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2014.00021/full">Tang &amp; Allesina 2014</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12312/full">Tang, Pawar, &amp; Allesina 2014</a>).
      I am particularly interested in applying random matrix techniques to bipartite networks (i.e. networks for which the nodes can be divided into groups such that all links are between nodes of disparate groups).

      Random matrices <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v238/n5364/abs/238413a0.html">&agrave; la May</a> look for patterns in matrix ensembles which randomize matrix elements.
      Advances since then have explored alternative modes of randomization (<a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12312/full">Tang, Pawar, &amp; Allesina 2014</a>), yet these still tend to focus on node degree and interaction strength correlation.
      An alternative form of randomization would be to preserve small network structures such as motifs or global network structures such as nestedness and modularity.
      I am interested in applying this technique to evaluate the importance and utility of small structures which are found <a target="_blank" href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824.short">at unexpected densities</a> in empirical networks.

      In addition to my central focus on ecology, I have also been interested in studying the process of doing science, especially aspects related to publication and evaluating performance.
      For instance, <a target="_blank" href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109195">one project</a> I have worked on looked at the influence of multinational affiliation lists on the success of publications.
      We confirmed <a target="_blank" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02459299">a historical result</a> that more countries improves both the quality of journal a paper is published into and the number of citations (compared to peer publications) it receives once published.
      Furthermore, we showed that the benefit differs according to which countries are in the affiliations -- some collaborations show much greater improvements than others and some actually decrease the expected number of citations!
