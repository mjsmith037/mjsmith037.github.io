      This talk was given as part of the Developmental Biology Center's weekly seminar series
      on the UMN Minneapolis campus in the spring of 2024. Text here will supplement slide material.
    </p><p>
      You can remove this pane (and get it back) by tapping <span class="key">v</span> on your keyboard.
    </p><p>
      Some of the slides will have animations which require advancing the
      slide partway through these explanations. These will be indicated by
      "<span id="ns">next slide</span>" in these notes.
    </p><p>
      Slides can be advanced by tapping<span class="key"><i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-right"></i></span>
      to display only the core slides, or <span class="key">Spc</span>,
      <span class="key">PgDn</span>, or <span class="key">n</span> to also show
      some supplemental slides throughout the presentation.
    </p><p>
      Finally, this presentation will look best in full-screen, but should
      be more or less intelligible on smaller screens (no guarantees about phone screens).
      So, whenever you're ready...

      Because this talk was given to a non-network-focused audience, I begin with a brief explanation
      of what a network is: namely, a set of nodes
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      connected by edges.
    </p><p>
      Because networks are intrinsically abstractions of real systems, there is flexibility
      in what the nodes and edges represent, here I show two islands, perhaps with species
      colonizing one from the other. But I could just as easily show animals moving between
      fragmented forest patches
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      Or people travelling between cities
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      Or livestock being moved between farms
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      Critically, networks are usually not made up of just two things, but rather represent
      many things connected through a sometimes complex web of relationships.
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      The relationship between the structure of these networks and the dynamics of the processes
      these neworks represent has been the central focus of my research for the past decade.

      comping back to our network of farms, previous research has noted that disease spread through
      agricultural systems can, in part, be predicted by the movement of individual animals between
      farms as part of the production process.

        The second aspect we considered is that each farm might therefore have its own dynamics
        of disease prevalence through time. To explore this possibility, we need a general disease
        model capable of displaying varied dynamics. We found a candidate model in the fox rabies
        model of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/289765a0">Anderson <i>et al.</i> 1981</a>.

      As alluded previously, the key feature of this model for our purposes is that, depending
      on the relationship between just two parameters, the model could exhibit a range of
      possible disease dynamics, which we discretized into:
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      The <span style="color:#ff5e5b;">pathogen going extinct</span>,
      the disease prevalence <span style="color:#0b6884;">approaching a steady level through time</span>,
      and the disease prevalence exhibiting some <span style="color:#bc4b51;">oscillatory behavior through time</span> (i.e.

      how do these dynamics change when we introduce host movement from one to the other?

      In the following slides, I will show timelines of disease prevalence to represent the
      disease dynamics. In general, the specifics of these timelines do not matter as much as the
      overall regime (oscillatory, steady-state, etc.) being shown. In these plots, I will use color
      to distinguish between farms, rather than to show dynamics as in earlier slides.
      First, we consider a toy system in which we have a set of farms parameterized to exhibit
      identical dynamics in isolation
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      each showing the same oscillatory behavior.
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      However, when we introduce movement between the orange and blue farms,
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      we see a reduction in the cycle amplitude at the destination (blue) farm.
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      A trend that is repeated as we add more farms to the chain.
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      Remember, each of these farms would look like the orange one if there were no
      host movement between farms.

        In the previous slide, we considered when identical farms were connected, but what if
        the connected farms differed in their dynamical regimes
      </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
        for instance, one having cyclical dynamics as before, but the other exhibiting steady
        state dynamics. What happens when we introduce a flow of individuals between these
        two populations?
      </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
        When the flow of individuals is from the cycles to the steady, we see a somewhat expected
        result: we introduce cycles to the blue farm. I say expected, because when prevalence is high
        in the orange farm, a higher proportion of hosts moving to the blue farm will be infectious,
        while it will be more susceptible and removed individuals when prevalence is low. Such variability
        in movement might likewise introduce variability into the destination. The more interesting
        result is that when the flow is reversed
      </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
        we see not only a reduction in cycles, but a qualitative change in dynamics, making the orange
        farm exhibit steady-state prevalence as well. In the supplementary slide below, we show that,
        while the rate of movement required to elicit each of these changes differs, very small
        rates of migration are needed to get this qualitative change.

        what happens when we have two farms (of differing dynamical regime) both providing hosts

      If migration in general reduces cycle amplitudes, we might expect networks with longer chains

      To test these predictions, in the absence of good-quality, large empirical datasets, we
      generated a suite of random networks according to five distinct random-graph generating
      algorithms, an representative network of each is shown here. For each 100 random graphs
      in each of these general types, we randomized local parameters in each patch and then
      ran simulated epidemics and evaluated the qualitative dynamical regime of each patch
      after a sufficiently long time for transient dynamics to have passed.
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      These are filled bar charts, where each patch in the network is a horizontal line, and
      vertical lines represent unique simulation runs. if the bar is completely one color (e.g.
      blue) from top to bottom, then every patch in the metapopulation had the same dynamics at
      the end of the simulation (e.g. cycles). If, instead, the color varies from top to bottom,
      then the dynamics vary across the network.
    </p><p>
      In accordance with our third prediction, we see mostly cyclical dynamics, but there was
      also an interesting difference between the left three network types and the right two.
      While the left networks tended to have either all cyclical or all steady state dynamics.
      On the right, we see much more heterogeneity across the metapopulation. Further analysis
      suggests that the key driver of this effect is variance in in-degree (i.e. some patches
      receive migrants from few other patches, while others receive from many).

      In summary, we found relatively simple, clear patterns when we consider the case of just

      In contrast, the results for larger networks were more complicated. While they were in agreement

      Further research is really needed to dig into these complexities and identify relationships between

      And, critically, the way we interact with others is highly context dependent. We interact
      with family members differently than classmates, or coworkers, or acquaintances on the street.
      With this in mind, we had to take a step back and consider how we could generate realistic

      To do this we had to answer a couple of basic questions, such as "What is a contact?"
      The answer to this question is obviously context specific, but with COVID-19, with its
      aerosolized transmission, we think about the risk of transmission increasing with the 
      duration of people sharing the same air space.

    <span id="ns">next slide</span>
    <p>
      But of course the ways in which we are close to other people is also context dependent,
      leading to the key insight for this project: the structure of our interactions with other
      people is dependent on the different ways in which we interact with different facets of our
      social network.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put it more concretely, interactions are structured differently among co-workers than among
      people at home, or at a religious institution. The differences in these interactions,
      including the strength of interaction and the interacting group size, can have consequences
      for the spread of disease.

      So, we begin to assemble our networks: starting with a collection of individuals, whose ages are
      distributed according to some locality's census data and grouping them into households, based on
      the empirical distribution of household sizes. We then successively layer additional interaction
      types, including schools

    <p>
      (based on empirical classroom sizes), work-places

      (according to empirical distributions of work-place sizes), and possibly others.

      Importantly, because each node has an age associated with it, we can also classify some
      individuals as being more vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID, using age-normalized
      hospitalization rates. Here, we dichotomize individuals into "Vulnerable" or "Not" for simplicity.

      I want to take a minute to run through the underlying disease model, but will keep this brief
      as it is not the most important aspect of this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      At each timestep in a simulation, every individual in the network has one of six states.
      They start out as <span class="blue">S</span>usceptible to disease and can become infected when they share an edge,
      representing a social contact, with an infectious individual.
    </p>
    <span id="ns">next slide</span>
    <p>
      Upon infection, they enter a latency period and are classified as <span class="green">E</span>xposed, but not yet infectious.
      Over time, they transition to being <span class="yellow">I</span>/<span class="orange">I</span>nfectious, and some fraction will develop symptoms.
    </p>
    <span id="ns">next slide</span>
    <p>
      As more time passes, some of these will <span class="purple">R</span>ecover,

    </p>
    <span id="ns">next slide</span>
    <p>
      The final piece of the puzzle is that those individuals that we classified as vulnerable have 
      both longer disease courses (slower recovery),
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      and are more likely to die, modifying these two parameters as shown.

    So, for a single simulated epidemic, we see nodes cycling through the various
    disease states, and, on the right, the proportion of the population in each
    class through time. Note that some individuals are able to escape infection,
    even at the end of the simulation, if they are sparsely connected to the rest of the
    network, or just very lucky.

      We can summarize the outcome of a single epidemic simulation in different ways, such as 
      the epidemic peak (the maximum proportion of the population ever concurrently infectious),
      the percentage of vulnerable individuals in the population that get sick at some point
      during the simulation, or the total percent of the population that dies from the disease.
    </p><p>
      For these first results, we compare the two age/household-size distributions, a "Florida-like"
      and a "Texas-like" population. The latter sees a higher epidemic peak and percentage of vulnerable
      individuals infected. This is likely driven by the larger household sizes, driving faster and wider
      pathogen spread.
    </p><p>
      Counter-intuitively, however, significantly more people die in the Florida-like population.
      This is because, even though the epidemics are smaller, there is a much higher proportion of
      vulnerable individuals in the Florida-like population, leading to higher mortality rates.

      We can also consider the relative contribution of each of our interaction network layers, here
      focusing on the contrast of classmate and co-worker interactions. We focus on this comparison
      because, at the time of writing, there was a large discussion about the relative merits of opening
      schools or workplaces as a phasing out of widespread lockdowns.
    </p><p>
      Our results showed that workplaces were more consequential (higher absolute value of effect size)
      for all measures of epidemic severity, including epidemic peak, total number of individuals
      infected, and rate of epidemic spread.
    </p><p>
      This is certainly influenced by our assumptions of network construction: we have more co-worker
      links in our networks than classmate. However, this decision of network construction is informed
      by the real-world: there are more working-age individuals than school-age children in the populations
      we consider and workplaces can be many times larger than schools and classrooms, so we do not view
      this as a limiation of the analysis per se.

      Finally, we considered the effects of differential risk-tolerance through the population.
      For all previous results, we considered a case where all individuals participated in all
      of their respective interactions. Here we show the effect of different rates of transmission
      between classmates or coworkers on the epidemic peak and the total number of vulnerable
      individuals infected. As expected, higher rates of transmission result in more disease (top right
      of each heatmap).
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      We next consider a situation where vulnerable individuals are less risk-tolerant, that is, 
      they take steps to reduce their infection risk through avoiding school or workplace interactions.
      In this case, we see a moderate reduction in disease, but mostly at low transmission rates.
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      We then asked, what if not only the vulnerable individuals themselves, but all members of their
      households likewise isolated. This would be like you deciding to work remotely because you live
      with your elderly parent/grandparent. In this case, we see a dramatic reduction in disease and a
      near-complete elimination of disease among vulnerable individuals.
    </p><p>
      Astute viewers might at this point be thinking "of course there is less disease, you've just removed
      a ton of links from the network!"
    </p><span id="ns">next slide</span><p>
      Yet, it is not the removal of links per-se, but rather the selective fragmentation of the contact
      network that yields such dramatic effects. When we remove the same number of links randomly (i.e.
      irrespective of relation to vulnerable individuals), we re-capture the no-difference levels of disease.

    <p>
      These results highlight how modern societies are highly interconnected, and how these connections
      make public health an intrinsically community-level problem. Individuals are not able to protect
      themselves, they need community action to be effective.
    </p><p>
      We also highlight how demography can have complex, sometimes counter-intuitive effects on
      disease spread.
    </p><p>
      Finally, we have taken this modelling framework and built an educational tool to help understand
      the relationship between network structure and disease spread
